# Multi-Tool
Android app, to contain basic tools that I need and am frustrated not to find easily.
To be honest, it's also an opportunity to play more with Kotlin, and a few things I want to experiment with.

# Sample stuff I want to see in:
A non exaustive list of feature that I intend to add there:
* [ ] A compass
* [ ] A simple color picker
* [ ] A morse code encoder/decoder
* [ ] 42

# Plan
* [ ] Come up with a few assets (icons, etc).
* [ ] Finish the compass.
* [ ] Setup an activity with a recycler view, to display the list of tools.
* [ ] Publish on the PlayStore.
* [ ] ?
